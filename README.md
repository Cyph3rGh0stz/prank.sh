# prank.sh

This was designed as a prank bash script to deploy on a friends Linux computer.
This file contains nothing malicious.
The prank is accomplished by a series of echo and sleep commands
The file is named automation.sh so that when downloaded it won't be immediately known as a prank script.
Have fun. Never hack someone without their permission.
(IF ANY DAMAGE DOES HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THIS SCRIPT BEING RUN, IT IS NOT MY FAULT.)
